Back-End: Improve SQL structure for database (consider establishing a relationship between moves in the learnset and Pokemon that get them?)?

Improve data processing for the regional and alternate forms.

Regional Forms need support for - 
Types, Base Stats, Cap Rate, Type Data, EVs, Movelists (aside from level-up)

Abilities support has improved dramatically, but a few slipped through the cracks:
Calyrex (and alternates).

Classifications support has improved dramatically, but a few slipped through the cracks:
Calyrex (and alternates), Meowth (and alternates).




Allow the user to access the database in a RESTful way, and provide support for moveset collision queries through GET requests.

Front-End:
Single-Page Application Design (Leave this to Athena for now).
