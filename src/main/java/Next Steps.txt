Back-End: Improve SQL structure for database (consider establishing a relationship between moves in the learnset and Pokemon that get them?) and migrate from H2 to a more robust database system (probably PostgreSQL, but setting that up might be a bit tricky)?

Improve data processing for the regional and alternate forms.


Allow the user to access the database in a RESTful way, and provide support for moveset collision queries through GET requests.

Front-End:
Single-Page Application Design (Leave this to Athena for now).
