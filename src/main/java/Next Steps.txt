Back-End: Improve SQL structure for database (consider establishing a relationship between moves in the learnset and Pokemon that get them?)?

Improve data processing for the regional and alternate forms.

Regional Forms need support for - 
Abilities, Types, Base Stats, Cap Rate, Classifications, Type Data, EVs, Movelists (aside from level-up)


Allow the user to access the database in a RESTful way, and provide support for moveset collision queries through GET requests.

Front-End:
Single-Page Application Design (Leave this to Athena for now).
