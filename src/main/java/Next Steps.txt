Back-End: Improve data processing for the regional and alternate forms.

Regional Forms need support for - 
Base Stats, Cap Rate, Egg Steps, EVs, Movelists (aside from level-up)

Abilities support has improved dramatically, but a few slipped through the cracks:
Ice Rider Calyrex and Shadow Rider Calyrex.

Classifications support has improved dramatically, but a few slipped through the cracks:
Calyrex (and alternates), Meowth (and alternates).

Allow the user to access the database in a RESTful way, and provide support for moveset collision queries through GET requests.

Front-End:
Single-Page Application Design.
